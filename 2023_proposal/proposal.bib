abstract = {Trusted execution environments (TEEs) in processors protect off-chip memory (DRAM), and ensure its confidentiality and integrity using memory encryption and integrity verification. However, such memory protection can incur significant performance overhead as it requires additional memory accesses for protection metadata such as version numbers (VNs) and MACs. This paper proposes SoftVN, an extension to the current memory protection schemes, which significantly reduces the overhead of today's state-of-the-art by allowing software to provide VNs for memory accesses. For memory-intensive applications with simple memory access patterns for large data structures, the VNs only need to be maintained for data structures instead of individual cache blocks and can be tracked in software with low efforts. Off-chip VN accesses for memory reads can be removed if they are tracked and provided by software. We evaluate SoftVN by simulating a diverse set of memory-intensive applications, including deep learning, graph processing, and bioinformatics algorithms. The experimental results show that SoftVN reduces the memory protection overhead by 82\% compared to the baseline similar to Intel SGX, and improves the performance by 33\% on average. The maximum performance improvement can be as high as 65\%.},

abstract = {This paper introduces MGX, a near-zero overhead memory protection scheme for hardware accelerators. MGX minimizes the performance overhead of off-chip memory encryption and integrity verification by exploiting the application-specific properties of the accelerator execution. In particular, accelerators tend to explicitly manage data movement between on-chip and off-chip memories. Therefore, the general memory access pattern of an accelerator can largely be determined for a given application. Exploiting these characteristics, MGX generates version numbers used in memory encryption and integrity verification using on-chip accelerator state rather than storing them in the off-chip memory; it also customizes the granularity of the memory protection to match the granularity used by the accelerator. To demonstrate the efficacy of MGX, we present an in-depth study of MGX for DNN and graph algorithms. Experimental results show that on average, MGX lowers the performance overhead of memory protection from 28\% and 33\% to 4\% and 5\% for DNN and graph processing accelerators in a wide range of benchmarks, respectively.},

abstract = {To achieve high performance with FPGA-equipped heterogeneous compute systems, it is crucial to co-optimize data placement and compute scheduling to maximize data reuse and bandwidth utilization for both on- and off-chip memory accesses. However, optimizing the data placement for FPGA accelerators is a complex task. One must acquire in-depth knowledge of the target FPGA device and its associated memory system in order to apply a set of advanced optimizations. Even with the latest high-level synthesis (HLS) tools, programmers often have to insert many low-level vendor-specific pragmas and substantially restructure the algorithmic code so that the right data are accessed at the right loop level using the right communication schemes. These code changes can significantly compromise the composability and portability of the original program. To address these challenges, we propose HeteroFlow, an FPGA accelerator programming model that decouples the algorithm specification from optimizations related to orchestrating the placement of data across a customized memory hierarchy. Specifically, we introduce a new primitive named .to(), which provides a unified programming interface for specifying data placement optimizations at different levels of granularity: (1) coarse-grained data placement between host and accelerator, (2) medium-grained kernel-level data placement within an accelerator, and (3) fine-grained data placement within a kernel. We build HeteroFlow on top of the open-source HeteroCL DSL and compilation framework. Experimental results on a set of realistic benchmarks show that, programs written in HeteroFlow can match the performance of extensively optimized manual HLS design with much fewer lines of code.},

abstract = {>98\% of the human genome is composed of noncoding regions and >93\% of these noncoding regions are actively transcribed, suggesting their criticality in the human genome. Yet <1\% of these regions have been functionally characterized, leaving most of the human genomes in the dark. Here, this study processes petabyte level data and systematically decodes endogenous lncRNAs located in unannotated regions of the human genome and deciphers a distinctive functional regime of lncRNAs hidden in massive RNAseq data. LncRNAs divergently distribute across chromosomes, independent of protein-coding regions. Their transcriptions rarely initiate on promoters through polymerase II, but rather partially on enhancers. Yet conventional enhancer markers (e.g. H3K4me1) only account for a small proportion of lncRNA transcriptions, suggesting alternatively unknown mechanisms initiating the majority of lncRNAs. Furthermore, lncRNA-self regulation also notably contributes to lncRNA activation. LncRNAs regulate broad bioprocesses, including transcription and RNA processing, cell cycle, respiration, response to stress, chromatin organization, post-translational modification, and development. Therefore, lncRNAs functionally govern their own regime distinctive from protein coding genes. This finding establishes a clear framework to comprehend human genome-wide lncRNA-lncRNA and lncRNA-protein coding gene regulations.}

Since the inception of elections and election technologies, all segments of the voting population have never been granted equal access, privacy and security when voting. Voting technology today has not addressed the issues that disabled voters are confronted with at the polls. Because approximately 17\% of the voting population is disabled, their issues should be handled with a solution geared towards their needs. Disabled voters need to be able to cast their vote without the assistance of others. The Prime III multimodal voting system addresses these issues. The video illustrates the use of the Prime III system and how it allows disabled voters to use the same system as those without disabilities.}

ABSTRACT = {The African continent (specifically its overwhelming in(animate) resources) is often referred to as the sleeping giant by magazines, blogs, research presentations and articles, and NGOs [such as World Bank]. Reasons for this moniker/title include the continent’s plentiful natural resources, its large and quickly growing young population, and the young population’s quick adoption and acclimatization to technology. Most countries on the continent are known as developing countries due to lack of access to safe drinking water, reliable electricity and roads, sanitation and hygiene, and a high number of people with tropical/infectious diseases. However, due to the usefulness of cellular phones and technology, several countries and companies within them have focused on cell phone proliferation (91\% in Kenya). Smart phone usage allows Kenyans access to the world’s information and potentially endless innovation. Given that a large number of Kenyans with smartphones use social media, coupled with the advent of Europe’s GDPR (general data protection regulation), African identity and its associated data became an area of great interest. As the world is quickly progressing into a digital economy, a solution must be created that allows us to regain and control our identities, doing our best to ensure losing such is infinitely close to computationally and probabilistically impossible/improbable. Developing a blockchain-based identity backbone using biometrics and historical family information while allowing government-based identification documents is the best way forward. Three stages have been identified as necessities to accomplish the development of this system before opening it further beyond the pan-African worldwide community. The three stages are defined by systems that allow for biometric/demographic registration (stage 1), interoperability and security hardening (stage 2), and biometric modality data analysis/organization/association (stage 3).}

Disordered regions are segments of the protein chain which do not adopt a stable structure. Recognition of disordered regions in a protein is of great importance for protein structure prediction, protein structure determination and function annotation as these regions have a close relationship with protein expression and functionality. As a result, a great many protein disorder prediction methods have been developed so far. Here, we present an overview of current protein disorder prediction methods including an analysis of their advantages and shortcomings. In order to help users to select alternative tools under different circumstances, we also evaluate 23 disorder predictors on the benchmark data of the most recent round of the Critical Assessment of protein Structure Prediction (CASP) and assess their accuracy using several complementary measures.}

  abstract = {CRISPR-Cas9-based genetic screens are a powerful new tool in biology. By simply altering the sequence of the single-guide RNA (sgRNA), one can reprogram Cas9 to target different sites in the genome with relative ease, but the on-target activity and off-target effects of individual sgRNAs can vary widely. Here, we use recently devised sgRNA design rules to create human and mouse genome-wide libraries, perform positive and negative selection screens and observe that the use of these rules produced improved results. Additionally, we profile the off-target activity of thousands of sgRNAs and develop a metric to predict off-target sites. We incorporate these findings from large-scale, empirical data     to improve our computational design rules and create optimized sgRNA libraries that maximize on-target activity and minimize off-target effects to enable more effective and efficient genetic screens and genome engineering.}

  abstract = {Computational prediction of protein structure from sequence is broadly viewed as a foundational problem of biochemistry and one of the most difficult challenges in bioinformatics. Once every two years the Critical Assessment of protein Structure Prediction (CASP) experiments are held to assess the state of the art in the field in a blind fashion, by presenting predictor groups with protein sequences whose structures have been solved but have not yet been made publicly  available. The first CASP was organized in 1994, and the latest, CASP13, took place last December, when for the first time the industrial laboratory DeepMind entered the competition. DeepMind's entry, AlphaFold, placed first in the Free Modeling (FM) category, which assesses methods on their ability to predict novel protein folds (the Zhang group placed first in the Template-Based Modeling (TBM)     category, which assess methods on predicting proteins whose folds are related to ones already in the Protein Data Bank.) DeepMind's success generated significant public interest. Their approach builds on two ideas developed in the academic community during the preceding decade: (i) the use of co-evolutionary analysis to map residue co-variation in protein sequence to physical contact in protein structure, and (ii) the application of deep neural networks to robustly identify patterns in protein sequence and co-evolutionary couplings and convert them into   contact maps. In this Letter, we contextualize the significance of DeepMind's entry within the broader history of CASP, relate AlphaFold's methodological advances to prior work, and speculate on the future of this important problem - © The Author(s) 2019.}

New content includes 284 full P-value summary statistics datasets for genome-wide and new targeted array studies, representing 6 * 109 individual variant-trait statistics. In the last 12 months, the Catalog's user interface was accessed by ∼90000 unique users who viewed >1 million pages. We have improved data access with the release of a new RESTful API to support high-throughput programmatic access, an improved web interface and a new summary statistics database.

GeneCup is a literature mining web service that retrieves sentences containing user-provided gene symbols and keywords from PubMed abstracts. The keywords are organized into an ontology and can be extended to include results from human genome-wide association studies. We provide a drug addiction keyword ontology that contains over 300 keywords as an example. The literature search is conducted by querying the PubMed server using a programming interface, which is followed by retrieving abstracts from a local copy of the PubMed archive. The main results presented to the user are sentences where gene symbol and keywords co-occur. These sentences are presented through an interactive graphical interface or as tables. All results are linked to the original abstract in PubMed. In addition, a convolutional neural network is employed to distinguish sentences describing systemic stress from those describing cellular stress. The automated and comprehensive search strategy provided by GeneCup facilitates the integration of new discoveries from omic studies with existing literature. GeneCup is free and open source software. The source code of GeneCup and the link to a running instance is available at https://github.com/hakangunturkun/GeneCup.}

A huge amount of high dimensional and complex structured data has made it no longer applicable for conventional machine learning algorithms. Fortunately, deep learning technology can contribute toward resolving these challenges. There is evidence that deep learning can handle omics data well and resolve omics problems. This survey aims to provide an entry-level guideline for researchers, to understand and use deep learning in order to solve omics problems. We first introduce several deep learning models and then discuss several research areas which have combined omics and deep learning in recent years. In addition, we summarize the general steps involved in using deep learning which have not yet been systematically discussed in the existent literature on this topic. Finally, we compare the features and performance of current mainstream open source deep learning frameworks and present the opportunities and challenges involved in deep learning. This survey will be a good starting point and guideline for omics researchers to understand deep learning.}

Microarrays typically measure expression across genomic space, creating a massive matrix of co-expression that must be mined to extract only the most relevant gene interactions. We describe a graph theoretical approach to extracting co-expressed sets of genes, based on the computation of cliques. Unlike the results of traditional clustering algorithms, cliques are not disjoint and allow genes to be assigned to multiple sets of interacting partners, consistent with biological reality. A graph is created by thresholding the correlation matrix to include only the correlations most likely to signify functional relationships. Cliques computed from the graph correspond to sets of genes for which significant edges are present between all members of the set, representing potential members of common or interacting pathways. Clique membership can be used to infer function about poorly annotated genes, based on the known functions of better-annotated genes with which they share clique membership (i.e., “guilt-by-association”). We illustrate our method by applying it to microarray data collected from the spleens of mice exposed to low-dose ionizing radiation. Differential analysis is used to identify sets of genes whose interactions are impacted by radiation exposure. The correlation graph is also queried independently of clique to extract edges that are impacted by radiation. We present several examples of multiple gene interactions that are altered by radiation exposure and thus represent potential molecular pathways that mediate the radiation response.},

It provides a web-based network modeling environment that seamlessly integrates advanced algorithms for probabilistic causal modeling and reasoning with Bayesian networks. BNW is designed for precise modeling of relatively small networks that contain less than 20 nodes. The structure learning algorithms used by BNW guarantee the discovery of the best (most probable) network structure given the data. To facilitate network modeling across multiple biological levels, BNW provides a very flexible interface that allows users to assign network nodes into different tiers and define the relationships between and within the tiers. This function is particularly useful for modeling systems genetics datasets that often consist of multiscalar heterogeneous genotype-to-phenotype data. BNW enables users to, within seconds or minutes, go from having a simply formatted input file containing a dataset to using a network model to make predictions about the interactions between variables and the potential effects of experimental interventions. In this chapter, we will introduce the functions of BNW and show how to model systems genetics datasets with BNW.}

Although accuracy and efficiency are common goals in many modeling tasks, model interpretability is especially important to these studies towards understanding the underlying molecular and cellular mechanisms. Deep neural networks (DNNs) have recently gained popularity in various types of genomic and epigenomic studies due to their capabilities in utilizing large-scale high-throughput bioinformatics data and achieving high accuracy in predictions and classifications. However, DNNs are often challenged by their potential to explain the predictions due to their black-box nature. In this review, we present current development in the model interpretation of DNNs, focusing on their applications in genomics and epigenomics. We first describe state-of-the-art DNN interpretation methods in representative machine learning fields. We then summarize the DNN interpretation methods in recent studies on genomics and epigenomics, focusing on current data- and computing-intensive topics such as sequence motif identification, genetic variations, gene expression, chromatin interactions and non-coding RNAs. We also present the biological discoveries that resulted from these interpretation methods. We finally discuss the advantages and limitations of current interpretation approaches in the context of genomic and epigenomic studies. Contact:xiaoman@mail.ucf.edu, haihu@cs.ucf.edu}",

Reactome thus functions both as a digital archive of manually curated human biological processes and as a tool for discovering functional relationships in data such as gene expression profiles or somatic mutation catalogs from tumor cells. Recent curation work has expanded our annotations of normal and disease-associated signaling processes and of the drugs that target them, in particular infections caused by the SARS-CoV-1 and SARS-CoV-2 coronaviruses and the host response to infection. New tools support better simultaneous analysis of high-throughput data from multiple sources and the placement of understudied (‘dark’) proteins from analyzed datasets in the context of Reactome’s manually curated pathways.}",

The resulting...Sharing human genotype and phenotype data is essential to discover otherwise inaccessible genetic associations, but is a challenge because of privacy concerns. Here, we present a method of homomorphic encryption that obscures individuals’ genotypes and phenotypes, and is suited to quantitative genetic association analysis. Encrypted ciphertext and unencrypted plaintext are analytically interchangeable. The encryption uses a high-dimensional random linear orthogonal transformation key that leaves the likelihood of quantitative trait data unchanged under a linear model with normally distributed errors. It also preserves linkage disequilibrium between genetic variants and associations between variants and phenotypes. It scrambles relationships between individuals: encrypted genotype dosages closely resemble Gaussian deviates, and can be replaced by quantiles from a Gaussian with negligible effects on accuracy. Likelihood-based inferences are unaffected by orthogonal encryption. These include linear mixed models to control for unequal relatedness between individuals, heritability estimation, and including covariates when testing association. Orthogonal transformations can be applied in a modular fashion for multiparty federated mega-analyses where the parties first agree to share a common set of genotype sites and covariates prior to encryption. Each then privately encrypts and shares their own ciphertext, and analyses all parties’ ciphertexts. In the absence of private variants, or knowledge of the key, we show that it is infeasible to decrypt ciphertext using existing brute-force or noise-reduction attacks. We present the method as a challenge to the community to determine its security.}",

Results from GWAS typically do not directly translate into causal variants because the majority of hits are in non-coding or intergenic regions, and the presence of linkage disequilibrium leads to effects being statistically spread out across multiple variants. Post-GWAS annotation facilitates the selection of most likely causal variant(s). Multiple resources are available for post-GWAS annotation, yet these can be time consuming and do not provide integrated visual aids for data interpretation. We, therefore, develop FUMA: an integrative web-based platform using information from multiple biological resources to facilitate functional annotation of GWAS results, gene prioritization and interactive visualization. FUMA accommodates positional, expression quantitative trait loci (eQTL) and chromatin interaction mappings, and provides gene-based, pathway and tissue enrichment results. FUMA results directly aid in generating hypotheses that are testable in functional experiments aimed at proving causal relations.}",

The current availability of hundreds of GWASs provides a unique opportunity to address these questions. We systematically analyzed 4,155 publicly available GWASs. For a subset of well-powered GWASs on 558 traits, we provide an extensive overview of pleiotropy and genetic architecture. We show that trait-associated loci cover more than half of the genome, and 90perc of these overlap with loci from multiple traits. We find that potential causal variants are enriched in coding and flanking regions, as well as in regulatory elements, and show variation in polygenicity and discoverability of traits. Our results provide insights into how genetic variation contributes to trait variation. All GWAS results can be queried and visualized at the GWAS ATLAS resource ( https://atlas.ctglab.nl ).},

  abstract     = {BACKGROUND: Quantitative trait locus (QTL) mapping identifies genomic regions that likely contain genes regulating a quantitative trait. However, QTL regions may encompass tens to hundreds of genes. To find the most promising candidate genes that regulate the trait, the biologist typically collects information from multiple resources about the genes in the QTL interval. This process is very laborious and time consuming. RESULTS: QTLminer is a bioinformatics tool that automatically performs QTL region analysis. It is available in GeneNetwork and it integrates information such as gene annotation, gene expression and sequence polymorphisms for all the genes within a given genomic interval. CONCLUSIONS: QTLminer substantially speeds up discovery of the most promising candidate genes within a QTL region.},

  abstract     = {Metabolic homeostasis is achieved by complex molecular and cellular networks that differ significantly among individuals and are difficult to model with genetically engineered lines of mice optimized to study single gene function. Here, we systematically acquired metabolic phenotypes by using the EUMODIC EMPReSS protocols across a large panel of isogenic but diverse strains of mice (BXD type) to study the genetic control of metabolism. We generated and analyzed 140 classical phenotypes and deposited these in an open-access web service for systems genetics (www.genenetwork.org). Heritability, influence of sex, and genetic modifiers of traits were examined singly and jointly by using quantitative-trait locus (QTL) and expression QTL-mapping methods. Traits and networks were linked to loci encompassing both known variants and novel candidate genes, including alkaline phosphatase (ALPL), here linked to hypophosphatasia. The assembled and curated phenotypes provide key resources and exemplars that can be used to dissect complex metabolic traits and disorders.},

  abstract     = {Neurexin 1 (NRXN1) is a large presynaptic transmembrane protein that has complex and variable patterns of expression in the brain. Sequence variants in NRXN1 are associated with differences in cognition, and with schizophrenia and autism. The murine Nrxn1 gene is also highly polymorphic and is associated with significant variation in expression that is under strong genetic control. Here, we use co-expression analysis, high coverage genomic sequence, and expression quantitative trait locus (eQTL) mapping to study the regulation of this gene in the brain. We profiled a family of 72 isogenic progeny strains of a cross between C57BL/6J and DBA/2J (the BXD family) using exon arrays and massively parallel RNA sequencing. Expression of most Nrxn1 exons have high genetic correlation (r>0.6) because of the segregation of a common trans eQTL on chromosome (Chr) 8 and a common cis eQTL on Chr 17. These two loci are also linked to murine phenotypes relevant to schizophrenia and to a novel human schizophrenia candidate gene with high neuronal expression (Pleckstrin and Sec7 domain containing 3). In both human and mice, NRXN1 is co-expressed with numerous synaptic and cell signaling genes, and known schizophrenia candidates. Cross-species co-expression and protein interaction network analyses identified glycogen synthase kinase 3 beta (GSK3B) as one of the most consistent and conserved covariates of NRXN1. By using the Molecular Genetics of Schizophrenia data set, we were able to test and confirm that markers in NRXN1 and GSK3B have epistatic interactions in human populations that can jointly modulate risk of schizophrenia.},

  abstract     = {The period homolog genes Per1, Per2 and Per3 are important components of the circadian cl
ock system. In addition to their role in maintaining circadian rhythm, these genes have been linked to mood
 disorders, stress response and vulnerability to addiction and alcoholism. In this study, we combined high-
resolution sequence analysis and quantitative trait locus (QTL) mapping of gene expression and behavioral t
raits to identify Per3 as a compelling candidate for the interaction between circadian rhythm, alcohol and
stress response. In the BXD family of mouse strains, sequence variants in Per3 have marked effects on stead
y-state mRNA and protein levels. As a result, the transcript maps as a cis-acting expression QTL (eQTL). We
 found that an insertion/deletion (indel) variant in a putative stress response element in the promoter reg
ion of Per3 causes local control of transcript abundance. This indel results in differences in protein bind
ing affinities between the two alleles through the Nrf2 transcriptional activator. Variation in Per3 is als
o associated with downstream differences in the expression of genes involved in circadian rhythm, alcohol,
stress response and schizophrenia. We found that the Per3 locus is linked to stress/anxiety traits, and tha
t the basal expression of Per3 is also correlated with several anxiety and addiction-related phenotypes. Tr
eatment with alcohol results in increased expression of Per3 in the hippocampus, and this effect interacts
with acute restraint stress. Our data provide strong evidence that variation in the Per3 transcript is caus
ally associated with and also responsive to stress and alcohol.},

For the mouse cohort, we amassed a deep and broad open-access phenome consisting of approximately 4,500 metabolic, physiological, pharmacological and behavioural traits, and more than 90 independent expression quantitative trait locus (QTL), transcriptome, proteome, metagenome and metabolome data sets--by far the largest coherent phenome for any experimental cohort (www.genenetwork.org). We tested downstream effects of subsets of variants and discovered several novel associations, including a missense mutation in fumarate hydratase that controls variation in the mitochondrial unfolded protein response in both mouse and Caenorhabditis elegans, and missense mutations in Col6a5 that underlies variation in bone mineral density in both mouse and human.},
