  ABSTRACT     = {BACKGROUND: Quantitative trait locus (QTL) mapping identifies genomic regions that likely contain genes 
                  regulating a quantitative trait. However, QTL regions may encompass tens to hundreds of genes. To find the most promising candidate genes that regulate the trait, the biologist typically collects information from multiple resources about the genes in the QTL interval. This process is very laborious and time consuming. RESULTS: QTLminer is a bioinformatics tool that automatically performs QTL region analysis. It is available in GeneNetwork and it integrates information such as gene annotation, gene expression and sequence polymorphisms for all the genes within a given genomic interval. CONCLUSIONS: QTLminer substantially speeds up discovery of the most promising candidate genes within a QTL region.},
