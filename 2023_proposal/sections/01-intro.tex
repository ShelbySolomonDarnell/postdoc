My community is medically under-served and statistically underrepresented in the (health) sciences. 
Recently I started attending a meeting with an NSF project run by Prins a.o. to build a special pangenome supercomputer in collaboration with Cornell. 
Unsurprisingly, with 25 people attending, I am the only black person in the room.
At a personal level, my young and non-obese sister has lost both kidneys because of complications from diabetes and hypertension, and I constantly ask myself `why' or what are the causal factors leading to such disaster.
Which further leads me to keep track of my own susceptibility to the same health issues, in order to avoid a similar disaster, while asking `what could she have done differently to avoid the cataclysm?'

As a postdoc working with the genetics, genomics and informatics (GGI) department at UTHSC and a computing specialist I want to focus my efforts on pointing my research trajectory to the answers of the aforementioned questions, and enabling others to accomplish the same with the tools created to enable my goals.

Causal inference, a new aspect of computer science and artificial intelligence pioneered by Turing award winner Judea Pearl\cite{Pearl:1995, Pearl:2009, Pearl:2018, Pearl:2019} and his collaborators, is a tool that enables one to use data, mathematics, and his own structural causal model to answer complicated questions hereto for unanswerable using pre-existing AI/ML methods.
However, before being able to apply such ground-breaking techniques to answer my questions; I must do the following:
\begin{itemize}[noitemsep]
    \item attend seminars and classes on Genetics and Genomics
    \item augment existing tools for \GN\
    \item understand and practice do-Calculus and structural causal models
    \item properly acquire the data needed to begin answering the questions of interest
\end{itemize}

In addition to working on topics about which I am passionate, one of the main purposes of a postdoc is to enable the all-around professional growth of a young researcher.
Hence the results of an individual development plan will be combined with my research interests to determine the outcomes of this postdoctoral research.
