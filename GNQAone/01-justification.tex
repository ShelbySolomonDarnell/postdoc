\section{Justification}
We demonstrate and deliberate on the development of an up-to-date and evolving expert system that utilizes cutting-edge AI technology to provide scientists who use and collaborate with the \GN\ ecosystem, while ensuring system implementation is easily reproducible using \guix. 
At the moment learning about and getting proper references for research topics is tedious and time-comsuning. 
With a consistently up-to-date expert system that presents data and studies pertinent to ones interest by asking a question in `regular' language is enviable, while now being quite possible.
We focus on limited domains with respect to rat and mouse genomics for the working prototype.
