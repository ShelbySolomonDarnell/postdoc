    NOTE          = {The advent of ChatGPT has ignited a debate over whether AI is advancing so rapidly that these powerful 
                     large language models will eventually evolve into artificial general intelligence, a computer algorithm 
                     that can think like a human. But a key missing component to AGI may be the ability for a computer program 
                     to determine cause and effect relationships. True intelligence, many argue, requires not just an ability 
                     to predict that A causes B, but to understand why.
                     While much of the media attention has been on large language models, the field of causal AI has gotten 
                     comparatively little. Darko Matovski, CEO of London-based causaLens, has become focused on this narrow 
                     field because he believes itâ€™s the next frontier in AI.
                     Major advances in causal AI have allowed causaLens to offer some powerful analytics to a diverse range 
                     of companies. But the promise of the technology goes far beyond enterprise software. If causal reasoning 
                     is combined with large language models, it could have a major impact on humanity. }
