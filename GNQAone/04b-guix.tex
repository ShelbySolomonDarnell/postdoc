\subsection{LLM development for full system reproducibility}
The current \project\ interfaces with an application programming interface (API) provided by \openai by way of FahamuAI, a Kenyan company specializing in artificial intelligence system development.
In order to have reproducible code, down the byte and bit levels, we use \guix\, an open source package management system that also can use containers to run software \cite{Vallet:2022_guix}.
