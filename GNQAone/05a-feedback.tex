    \hline
    \cyan{What is the most recent paper published using the BXD population?} & \violet{The most recent paper published using the BXD population is from 2018.} \violet{The most recent paper published using the BXD population is from 2019.} & \brown{\textit{I am assuming the two different responses (some days apart) are because the database of papers is being actively expanded. I can’t actually verify the LLMs statement as the citation information is not exposed yet (just a hash). The top hit quotes from David’s ‘expanded BXD family’ paper from 2019, so it seems OK. Not sure why there is more than one hit for this query though (is the LLM actually collecting dates and finding the max? Or is it just making up text?)}} \\
    \hline
    \cyan{How many strains are available for the BXD population?} &\violet{There are a totoal of 123 BXD strains available.} & \brown{\textit{I have received some different values, but all under the 150 quoted in David's 2019 paper (which we know from above is in the reading list).}} \\
    \hline
    \cyan{How are C57BL/6 and DBA/2 different?} & \violet{C57BL/6 and DBA/2 differ in their ability to respond to xenobiotics.} & \brown{\textit{I saw some different responses, all quoed from single references - not a summary as I would have liked to see.}} \\
    \hline
    \cyan{Is C57BL/6 smarter than DBA/2?} & \violet{There is no mention of intelligence in the text.} & \brown{\textit{OK - fair enough. ChatGPT gives a lyrical response about the multifaceted nature of intelligence. Not sure which is more honest :) This was a stupid question anyway just to test the breath of the summarising abilities.}} \\
    \hline 
    \cyan{Which mouse strain has the biggest brain?} & \violet{The C57BL/6J (C57) mouse strain has the biggest brain.} & \brown{\textit{This is broadly true I think, in the realm of standard strains.}} \\
    \hline
    \cyan{What is the typical weight of a mouse liver?} & \violet{The average liver weight in a normal mice is 10 mg per g wet weight.}  \violet{The average weight of a mouse liver is 3.5 grams.} & \brown{\textit{Two very different answers on different days. Both wrong. I thought this would be one that an LLM could deal with.}} \\
    \hline
    \cyan{What behavioural QTLs have been found in mice?} & \violet{Two QTLs located on chromosomes 1 and 5 modulate different aspects of the performance of mice of the B x D Ty RI strain series in the Morris navigation task.} & \brown{\textit{Sounds like it has been ripped verbatim from a single paper. Edit: Yes, this is from reference \#3.“Two QTLs located on chromosomes 1 and 5 modulate different aspects of the performance of mice of the BXD Ty RI strain series in the Morris navigation task. Behav Genet. 2002; 32:6978. [PubMed: 11958544] Mozhui RT, Ciobanu DC, Schikorski T, Wang XS, Lu L, Williams RW. Dissection of a QTL hotspot on mouse distal chromosome 1 that modulates neurobehavioral phenotypes and gene expression. PLoS Genetics. 2008; 4:e1000260. [PubMed: 19008955] Mulligan MK, Wang X, Adler AL, Mozhui K, Lu L, Williams RW. Complex control of GABA(A) receptor subunit mRNA expression: variation, covariation, and genetic regulation. PLoS One. 2012; 7(4):e34586.” Here, it looks like a part of the References section has been used in the text mining. That is a problem if the aim mis to link statements to correct citations. I don’t know what the source reference is (still just a hash) but it is very likely NOT the source of the response text.}} \\
    \hline 
    \cyan{What are these QTLs?} & \violet{These QTLs are stretches of DNA that are closely linked to genes that underlie a phenotype of interest.} & \brown{\textit{I was hoping for more information about the previous query. I got basically the same response when asking the same question in a different session though, so there is no evidence of contextual memory. I didn’t pursue this further.}} \\
    \hline
    \cyan{What does QTL mean?} & \violet{Quantitative trait locus (QTL) is a gene or group of linked genes that influence a quantitative trait.} & \brown{\textit{OK, but weak answer given that this is exactly the sort of situation wher an LLM should shine. Would it perhaps make sense to give the LLM the FAQ data as part of its training?}} \\
