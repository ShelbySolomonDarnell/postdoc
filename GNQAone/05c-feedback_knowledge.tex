    What is the most recent paper published using the BXD population? & \textbf{The most recent paper published using the BXD population is from 2018. The most recent paper published using the BXD population is from 2019.} & \textit{I am assuming the two different responses (some days apart) are because the database of papers is being actively expanded. I can’t actually verify the LLMs statement as the citation information is not exposed yet (just a hash). The top hit quotes from David’s ‘expanded BXD family’ paper from 2019, so it seems OK. Not sure why there is more than one hit for this query though (is the LLM actually collecting dates and finding the max? Or is it just making up text?)} \\

    How many strains are available for the BXD population? &\textbf{There are a totoal of 123 BXD strains available.} & \textit{I have received some different values, but all under the 150 quoted in David's 2019 paper (which we know from above is in the reading list).} \\
