\section{Performance}

Speak to the qualitative and quantitative shortcomings of the system as it exists.
Some shortcomings are in the GUI and others have to do with how the model is tuned, and now there are some improvemets our collaborators need to make.

As the work moves on system performance will be measured by speed of inference, speed of lookup, how answers compare to large non-specilized \llms, usefulness, usability, ease-of-use, and receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve.
