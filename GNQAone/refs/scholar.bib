  PUBLISHER = {University of North Texas Library},
  ABSTRACT  = {The paper has two parts. The first part is an overview of GPT technology and the ChatGPT
               interface. The second part is a transcript of an interview of sorts. This interview was unique in
               that it was not conducted with a living being, but rather an AI interface. All of the questions that
               you read come from a human user, but all of the answers (labeled “A:”) were written entirely by
               the platform ChatGPT, created by the OpenAI program. It should be noted that ChatGPT is not
               perfect and there are many issues that will be identified and improved upon in the future, but this
               paper gives a taste of the platform and how it may impact our scholarly publishing
               infrastructure.This paper will begin with an introduction to ChatGPT and then proceed into the
               transcript of a conversation with the platform about it and related AI technologies’ impact on the
               future of scholarly publishing, before concluding with some discussion on the further
               implications.}

  ABSTRACTNOTE = {The expert system is a computer system that emulates                  the decision-making ability of a human expert, which
                  aims to solve complex problems by reasoning knowledge. It is an important branch of artificial intelligence. In this paper, firstly, we briefly introduce the development and basic structure of the expert system. Then, from the perspective of the enabling technology, we classify the current expert systems and elaborate four expert systems: The Rule-Based Expert System, the Framework-Based Expert System, the Fuzzy Logic-Based Expert System and the Expert System Based on Neural Network.},

  ABSTRACT = {This paper surveys expert systems (ES) development using 
              a literature review and classification of articles from 1995 to 2004 with a keyword index and article abstract in order to explore how ES methodologies and applications have developed during this period. Based on the scope of 166 articles from 78 academic journals (retrieved from five online database) of ES applications, this paper surveys and classifies ES methodologies using the following eleven categories: rule-based systems, knowledge-based systems, neural networks, fuzzy ESs, object-oriented methodology, case-based reasoning, system architecture, intelligent agent systems, database methodology, modeling, and ontology together with their applications for different research and problem domains. Discussion is presented, indicating the followings future development directions for ES methodologies and applications: (1) ES methodologies are tending to develop towards expertise orientation and ES applications development is a problem-oriented domain. (2) It is suggested that different social science methodologies, such as psychology, cognitive science, and human behavior could implement ES as another kind of methodology. (3) The ability to continually change and obtain new understanding is the driving power of ES methodologies, and should be the ES application of future works.}
