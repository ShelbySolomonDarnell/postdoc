\subsection{GNQA: A Development Roadmap}
There are 3 major development phases for this system:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Design and development of a fully-functioning question answering system using OpenAI's APIs, along with software oracles
    \item Build our own LLM using OSS software and techniques; therefore, replacing OpenAI's system
    \item Incorporate other OSS LLM projects as necessary
\end{enumerate}

Each of these development phases is a significant research and development undertaking that will be published and help push forward research and research access in the age of high-performing large language models.
In addition for each phase of development we will define and adhere to specific performance and satisfaction evaluations; including ease of use, usability and utility.


As far as computational intelligence researchers are concerned, the techniques pursued and implemented will be a part of the road-map to artificial general intelligence.
