Science careers has a tool to aide young researchers in building an individual development plan, called
\hyperlink{https://myidp.sciencecareers.org}{myIDP}.

\subsection{Strong skills}
\begin{enumerate}[noitemsep]
    \item basic writing and editing
    \item writing for nonscientists
    \item speaking clearly and effectively
    \item presenting to nonscientists

    \item serving as a role model
    \item careful recordkeeping practices
    \item understanding of data ownership/sharing issues
    \item demonstrating responsible authorship and publication practices
    \item demonstrating responsible conduct in human research
    \item how to maintain a professional network
    \item technical skills related to my specific research area
\end{enumerate}


\subsection{Weak Skills \& Deficiencies}

\begin{enumerate}[noitemsep]
    \item contributing to institution (e.g. participate on committees)
    \item demonstrating responsible conduct in animal research
    \item how to negotiate
    \item statistical analysis
    \item seeking advice from advisors and mentors
    \item developing/managing budgets
    \item how to interview
    \item delegating responsibilities
    \item writing grant proposals
    \item planning and organizing projects
    \item navigating the peer review process
\end{enumerate}

As a postdoc is usually 2-3 years long, a schedule of activities will be planned and evaluated by my mentors.
This schedule will include learning activities, speaking engagements, research, writing, collaboration, and working on specific weak skills and deficiencies.
Concerning the research component of the plan, three major aims will be 
\begin{enumerate}[noitemsep]
    \item Differential privacy algorithm development and testing
	\item[Aim] Aide in development of new pangenome layout algorithms
	\item[Aim] Support broader impact initiatives 
\end{enumerate}
