Hi Pjotr,

Remember that if you want to fund off the PPoSS grant you need to subm=
it a budget reallocation from GRA to postdoc funding and also upload a post=
doc mentoring plan.

I have only ever submitted one proposal with a postdoc, but I am happy to s=
hare what I learned. You can find sample plans online if you do a google se=
arch. I have also attached a template that one of the grant specialists sen=
t me.

Cornell actually has an Office of Postdoctoral Studies:

  http://postdocs.cornell.edu<http://postdocs.cornell.edu/>

If UT or UTHSC has one that would probably be a big help? I have attached s=
ome documents that they sent me about some of the resources available at Co=
rnell for our postdocs. After talking with the Office of Postdoctoral Studi=
es, she mentioned that other PIs have included a letter of commitment with =
their proposal -- this is not supposed to be a letter of support, but is in=
stead a letter stating that the Office of Postdoctoral Studies will help su=
pport the postdoc. This seems like a very good idea since it clearly indica=
tes that there are institutional resources to help support post-docs.

Based on all of this I put together the attached post-doctoral mentoring pl=
an and included the attached letter of commitment on the grant that Christo=
ph and I wrote. Based on what I read I thought it was important to make sur=
e I covered "Orientation", "Career Development Plan", "Experience with Prep=
aration of Grant Proposals", "Publications and Presentations", "Teaching De=
velopment", and "Evaluation and Feedback".

Hope this helps!
Chris
